# Introduction

The course consists of a lecture, computer laboratory and project.

The course is elective. The rules of passing may seem non-standard. Make sure that you understand them to avoid unpleasant consequences.
I believe that one of the most important skills in building ML/XAI models is flexibility and a proactive approach to the problem. In this course the assessment criteria will strongly reward both flexibility and a proactive approach.
