# Introduction

The course consists of a lecture, computer laboratory and project.

The course is elective. The rules of passing may seem non-standard. Make sure that you understand them to avoid unpleasant consequences.
I believe that one of the most important skills in building ML/XAI models is flexibility and a proactive approach to the problem. In this course the assessment criteria will strongly reward both flexibility and a proactive approach.

# How to get a good grade

From different activities you can get from 0 to 100 points. 51 points are needed to pass this course.
There are three key components.

Chapter in the 'XAI stories' [0-60 points]
 - quality of trained predictive models [0-10 points]
 - quality of dataset level explanations [0-10 points]
 - quality of instance level explanations [0-10 points]
 - quality of the charts/visuals/diagrams [0-10 points]
 - the relevance of the example [0-10 points]
 - presentation of key results during the final meeting [0-10 points]

Presentation of a selected XAI related article [0-10 points]

Home works [0-30 points]
 - home work 1 [0-5 points]
 - home work 2 [0-5 points]
 - home work 3 [0-5 points]
 - home work 4 [0-5 points]
 - home work 5 [0-5 points]
 - home work 6 [0-5 points]


# Projects

Project proposals are described as issues in this repository. Each issue is a single problem in which you need to train few predictive models and explain them. Among different issues you will fond applications in different areas, some concern medical data, some concern financial data. 

Each group of students should choose one issue they want to solve. After consultation with the lecturer you can also submit your own projects.
Projects should be solved in groups. The ideal group consists of three people, one student from each university (PW, US, SGH).
Data Scientists from McKinsey will  help us with these projects. More details about the rules of cooperation will be given during classes.

The project ends with a small article prepared in English and a short presentation summarizing the key results. The study will be available to the public in the form of open-gitbook. 

See [Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods](https://compstat-lmu.github.io/iml_methods_limitations/) as an example to follow. During this course we are going to gather a number of use-cases/success stories for explainable machine learning.

# Literature

Literature will be added on an ongoing basis. 

* [Explanatory Model Analysis. Explore, Explain and Examine Predictive Models](https://pbiecek.github.io/ema/)
* [Interpretable Machine Learning. A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)
